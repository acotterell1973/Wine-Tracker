# Wine-Tracker

This repo is a fun little project that I'm currently working on that will utilize a lot of the emerging technologies from Microsoft, which includes:
  1: BOT with LUIS integration for helping the users navigate their way through the app. 
  2: Vision API for extracting text to help reducing the typing the user has to do
  3: Face/Voice API for user authentication
  4: Xamarin for the iOS mobile development
  

The application itself is a simple wine catalog, that will help a user to remember their favorite wines consume over time. The goal is, after playing with the technology and idea, is to make it social.
