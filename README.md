# Wine-Tracker

This repo is a fun little project that I'm currently working on that will utilize a lot of the emerging technologies from Microsoft, which includes: <br><br>
<ul>
<li>BOT with LUIS integration for helping the users navigate their way through the app. <br></li>
<li>Vision API for extracting text to help reducing the typing the user has to do <br></li>
<li>Face/Voice API for user authentication <br></li>
<li>Xamarin for the iOS mobile development <br></li>
</ul>
<br><br>
The application itself is a simple wine catalog, that will help a user to remember their favorite wines consume over time. The goal is, after playing with the technology and idea, is to make it social.
